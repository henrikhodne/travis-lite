# Travis Lite

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/henrikhodne/travis-lite.png?branch=master)](https://travis-lite.com/henrikhodne/travis-lite) |
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/henrikhodne/travis-lite)

Travis Lite is a more light-weight interface to the [Travis CI][] continuous
integration service. It's meant for users who for various reasons can't or won't
use the JavaScript-heavy main site.

[Travis CI]: http://travis-ci.org

## Live Version

There is a version of this app live at <http://travis-lite.com>.

Travis Lite is set up to deploy as soon as a build passes on master. See
`script/deploy` for details.
