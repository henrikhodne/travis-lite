Want to contribute to Travis Lite? Awesome! Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Run the tests. Pull requests will only be accepted if the tests are passing,
   and it's great to know that you have a clean slate: `bundle install && rake`.
3. Add tests for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require
   no new test. If you're adding functionality or fixing a bug, a test is needed
   to make sure it's not broken in the future.
4. Make the tests pass.
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

I'm currently in the progress of adding tests, so if the component you're
changing doesn't already have tests, it's fine to submit a Pull Request without
tests.
